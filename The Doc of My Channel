Firstly 

a bit of introduction 

My name is Sean 

I started my career as Formula 1 journalist 

Initially for a print magazine later switched to video

Then I became the press officer after to Cheetah Formula E

In these two jobs

I'm usually the only Chinese speaking person in the entire paddock.

So there I learned the skills necessary to work in a international environment .

In 2018

I started commentating Formula 1 for the Shanghai TV station. 

And we can it

That was two about three weeks ago .

And then started the Telescope

so ,my director at the time asked me a few others to go to try a products

at that time, it was only xxx for test drive.

In the tours to my colleagues 

I said

It is very similar to a model know very about.

The xxx this boat
